# Cordova plugin for Fire TV / Firestick

This project inserts additional properties into the `AndroidManifest.xml` so that the
built `APK` is compatible with the Amazon Firestick when submitting to the Amazon store.

## Install

`cordova plugin add https://github.com/kublikon/cordova-plugin-fire-tv.git`
